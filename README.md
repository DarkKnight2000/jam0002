# Jam #2

Welcome to the second langjam!

This jam begins at 7pm UK time on the 3rd of December and runs until 7pm UK time on the 10th of December.

## Theme

The theme will be announced at the start of the jam

## Getting started

To participate:
* fork this repo
* make a copy of the TEMPLATE directory
* rename the copy to the name of your languages (for example, if your language is "starlang" rename TEMPLATE to starlang)
* update the TEAM file in the directory with the name of your team members. Team members should be listed by their GitHub username. The first username on the list of team members is the team captain (see below)
* send a PR to submit your project. In this PR, only touch files in the directory you're creating for your language and no other directories.

Language names are "first come, first served" so if someone else takes your language name you'll need to come up with a new one.

## Language names

Please keep your language name "family-friendly". Sole discretion for what counts as "family friendly" is left up to JT, but if the name is safe/kid-friendly you should be fine.

## Team sizes

Teams can have one person or multiple people.

## Time limits

Each person on the team can spend a maximum of 48 hours coding and 12 hours writing documentation and presentation. The final language, including all documentation and presentation, needs to be submitted using a PR to this repository before the cut-off time.

## Submitting your project

When you submit your project, send a PR that updates *only* your languages's directory and nothing else. 

In the PR, submit:
* your project's source
* a README.md that describes how to build and use the project
* sample files written in your language
* links to any presentation you might have (websites, videos, etc)

## Team captains

The team captains will be the ones responsible for updating the submission. You may update your project up until the cut-off time.

## Help, I've never used GitHub

You can read through the helpful [hello world from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). If you've never forked a repo, you can check out the [GitHub forking tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

## Timeline

The langjam begins at 7pm UK time 3rd of December and runs until the 7pm UK time the 10th of December. At 7pm UK time on the 10th of December, we'll end submissions for the jam. **Make sure you have submitted your PR before this cut-off**.

## Judging

Judging will take place after the jam has ended. Once judging has concluded, we'll pick a set of winning projects that will become part of a video on the [Systems with JT](https://www.youtube.com/user/giard321) YouTube channel.

You're welcome to try out other projects. We'll have a way to leave comments so you can share your thoughts and vote on which you liked best, too.
